# aimaster-operator

aimaster-operator is a standalone Kubernetes operator for AIMaster, 
which manages the lifecycle of AIMaster and helps deep learning jobs to connect to AIMaster. With aimaster-operator,
users no longer require customized job operators to use AIMaster, making it easier to deploy AIMaster in native environments,
e.g., Kubeflow.
